/**
 * Regression test for SnapshotStore.selectedTower mirroring.
 *
 * The selected tower object reference is kept stable across ticks (to preserve
 * identity for TowerPanel's interval setup), but its mutable fields must be
 * refreshed through the reactive proxy so Vue dependency tracking fires. A raw
 * Object.assign on the cached underlying object updated the values but did NOT
 * trigger reactivity, leaving the Upgrade button (canUpgrade cost/level) stale
 * after an upgrade.
 *
 * Snapshots are produced only through the sanctioned serializer (buildSnapshot)
 * from a real GameEngine, never hand-built wire literals — engine/entity fields
 * are set as input fixtures.
