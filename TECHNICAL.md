# Technical Details

Everything a developer (human or LLM) needs to orient to, navigate, and modify the codebase.

## Rendering Architecture

The entire rendered area of the game uses a single `<svg>` root element where every map tile, tower, enemy, projectile, and visual effect is an SVG element. Sprite definitions are generated from `<symbol>` templates in `<defs>` and instantiated via `<use>` elements with imperatively-set `href` attributes. A single `requestAnimationFrame` loop on the main thread drives imperative DOM writes by reading the latest `SimulationSnapshot` produced by the simulation, which runs in a Web Worker. This eliminates the previous hybrid Canvas + DOM overlay architecture. See the new "Simulation Spine (Worker / Snapshot / Command)" design decision below.

## Key Design Decisions

### Single SVG Root with Imperative DOM Rendering

The game uses a single `<svg>` root element managed by `SvgGameRoot.vue`, replacing the previous two-layer Canvas + DOM overlay architecture. All visual content — grid tiles, towers, enemies, projectiles, particles, and effects — is rendered as SVG elements.

- **Vue (Declarative):** Manages structural changes (map loading, building/selling towers, opening shops). Mounts the root SVG and static layers via `v-html` for the grid.
- **GameEngine (Logic, in Web Worker):** Orchestrates all game logic (enemy movement, tower targeting, projectile updates, wave management). Constructor takes plain `PersistState` + `ThemeBundle` + `HostBindings` + `mapIndex` (plus optional `randomMapParams` and `particleSpawner`) — no Pinia, no canvas reference. `GameRunState` is created internally in `_initMap`, not passed in. `handleClick()` accepts world coordinates; `setHover` was removed (hover is main-thread-only UI state). The engine runs inside the Web Worker (`src/sim/WorkerEntry.ts`), not on the main thread.
- **Direct DOM (Imperative Rendering):** A main-thread `requestAnimationFrame` loop reads the latest `SimulationSnapshot` from the `SnapshotStore` and writes per-frame properties via `setAttribute` and `style.transform`. It does not call the engine directly — all intent flows in as `Command`s and all state flows out as snapshots. Bypasses Vue's reactivity system for hot paths.

The SVG structure is:

```
<svg class="game-svg" viewBox="0 0 W H">
  <defs>  <!-- <symbol> templates, filters, per-map gradients -->
  <g class="grid-layer" v-html="gridContent"></g>  <!-- Static, Vue-managed -->
  <g ref="worldLayer" class="camera-wrapper">  <!-- Imperative camera transform -->
    <g ref="entityLayer"></g>      <!-- Towers & Enemies as <use> elements -->
    <g ref="uiOverlayLayer"></g>   <!-- HP bars, shield bars, boss text -->
    <g ref="projectileLayer"></g>  <!-- Projectiles as <circle>/<line> -->
    <g ref="effectLayer"></g>     <!-- Particles, lightning, stuns -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

**Key SVG concepts:**

- `<symbol>`/`<use>`: Sprite definitions are `<symbol>` templates in `<defs>`, instantiated as `<use>` elements. Animation is driven by updating the `href` attribute each frame.
- CSS transforms on SVG: Elements use `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: 0 0;` for predictable positioning.
- CTM-based input: Mouse coordinates are converted to world space via `worldLayer.getScreenCTM().inverse()`, which includes the camera transform (unlike `svgRoot.getScreenCTM()` which only accounts for the viewBox).
- Click handling is centralized on the SVG root — no per-element `@click` handlers. `gameEngine.handleClick(worldX, worldY)` determines what was hit programmatically.

`GameScreen.vue` renders `<SvgGameRoot>` as a sibling with HUD/shop/tower panel overlays. Vue does **not** touch per-frame rendering. The component creates the Web Worker, posts `lifecycle:init` (with `persistState` + `themeBundle`), owns `SnapshotStore` and the `WorkerCommandDispatcher`, reads the reactive snapshot mirror from Pinia stores, and cleans up on unmount (posts `lifecycle:dispose`, awaits the worker's `disposed` ack, then terminates). The SVG mounts/unmounts with the `/game` route.

### Four Pinia Stores

- **`gameStore`** — reactive mirror/projection of the simulation `SimulationSnapshot`. The worker is authoritative for simulation state; `gameStore` holds the subset the Vue UI binds to (lives, gold, wave, game state, selection, time scale, dialog visibility, frame id, run gem/boss counters, milestone breakdown, end-screen data) and is updated by snapshot diffs each frame. Main-thread-only state (camera, hover tile, hover-upgrade-button, tower/panel positions, random-map params, worker reference) also lives here. Reset when starting a new map.
- **`persistStore`** — persistent meta-progression (gems, unlocked skills, map progress, difficulty, general add-ons, random-map preferences, last-selected theme). Auto-saved to `localStorage` via manual `save()` calls.
- **`uiStore`** — UI overlay visibility and confirm dialog state, plus notifications, minimap toggle, enemy commander selection ("none"/"stubby"/"stubbs"), random-map panel visibility, and wasPlaying flags for pause/skill-tree/help (so closing these overlays restores the prior playing/paused state).
- **`mapThemeStore`** — map theme state: `defaultTheme` (preloaded at app init for synchronous access by non-game screens) and `activeTheme` (resolved for the current run), plus `availableThemes` and preload/load actions.

### Confirm Dialogs as a Single Component

`ConfirmDialog.vue` is mounted globally in `App.vue` and uses `<Teleport to="body">` to render above all layers. Driven by `uiStore.confirmDialog` state.

### Simulation Spine (Worker / Snapshot / Command)

The simulation runs in a Web Worker; the main thread renders and produces intent. They communicate only through a **snapshot + command stream** (the "spine"), as detailed in `plans/ArchitecturePlan.md` §3.

- **Worker owns the engine.** `src/sim/WorkerEntry.ts` constructs `GameEngine` (with plain `GameRunState` + `PersistState` + `HostBindings` + `ThemeBundle`, not Pinia), runs a `setTimeout` fixed-timestep loop, drains a command queue at the start of each tick, and posts a `SimulationSnapshot` every tick. `requestAnimationFrame` is unavailable in a worker, so a `setTimeout`-driven loop is used instead.
- **Commands in (`src/sim/Command.ts`).** All intent is a typed `Command`: `input:*` (e.g. `input:click`), `action:*` (pause, cycle speed, upgrade, sell, select tower/build type, targeting, …), `lifecycle:*` (`init`/`dispose`), and future `llm:*`. The main thread dispatches via `commandBus.dispatchCommand` → `WorkerCommandDispatcher`, which forwards through `postMessage`. Hover and camera are main-thread-only and never become commands.
- **Snapshots out (`src/sim/SimulationSnapshot.ts`, `SnapshotSerializer.ts`).** Each tick the worker serializes plain-data DTOs — `enemies`, `towers`, `projectiles`, `particleSpawns` (sparse spawn requests, consumed once by the main thread), `spawnStates`, `paths`/`pathsVersion` (worker-authoritative enemy paths for highlight rendering), `waveGraphDots`/`waveGraphDotsGeneration` (per-interval wave-graph data, shipped only when generation changes), `gridLayout` (constant map layout for the commander worker, omitted once cached), `lightningEffects`/`stunEffects` (ephemeral visual effects, consumed and cleared each build), plus a `meta` scalar block (lives, gold, wave, selection, `lastScaledDt`, etc.) and a `persistDirty` flag. `SnapshotSerializer.buildSnapshot` reads entity fields directly; the render managers' `syncFromGameEngine` signatures now take these snapshot arrays.
- **Reactive mirror (`src/sim/SnapshotStore.ts`).** On the main thread, `SnapshotStore` holds the latest snapshot and diff-mirrors `meta` into `gameStore` (the reactive projection). The rAF render loop reads from the `SnapshotStore`, never from the engine. `gameStore` is a cache; the worker is authoritative, and reconciliation happens within one frame.
- **HostBindings seam (`src/sim/HostBindings.ts`).** The sim reaches the outside world only through `HostBindings`: `playSound`, `notifyUi`, `schedulePersistSave`, `syncGridTower`, `requestConfirm`. Implemented twice — `WorkerHostBindings` (worker → `postMessage`) and `MainThreadHostBindings` in `src/sim-adapters/` (main thread → `SoundManager`/`uiStore`/`persistStore`). This seam is what made the worker migration behavior-preserving at every step.
- **Persistence batching.** The worker sets `persistDirty` on persist mutations and the host flushes `schedulePersistSave` only on significant events (wave change, game-over/victory, new milestone claim, or a 5s fallback), avoiding a `localStorage` write per mutation.

### Snapshot Backpressure (Worker → Main Ack Gate)

The worker simulates at a fixed 60 Hz unconditionally, but `buildSnapshot()` +
`postMessage()` are **gated** on the main thread having consumed the previous
snapshot. This avoids allocating and structured-cloning a snapshot on ticks the
renderer never drained (underpowered machines, 30 Hz displays, brief main-thread
stalls). The gate never blocks the simulation — only the snapshot build/post.

- **Handshake:** the worker sets a module-level `awaitingAck = true` after each
  post. The main thread's rAF render loop sends `{ type: "snapshotAck" }` once
  per *rendered* frame (after the render-manager `syncFromGameEngine` calls,
  before rescheduling rAF). The worker clears `awaitingAck` on `snapshotAck`. A
  running-idle tick with `awaitingAck === true` drops the build+post entirely.
- **Forced posts bypass the gate** (so input latency stays ≤1 frame): the
  *baseline* (first snapshot after `(re)init`) and any tick where a `Command`
  mutated visible state (`stateMutatedThisTick`, paused **or** running). A
  running-command post sets `awaitingAck = true` (next running tick throttles
  again); a paused-command post sets `awaitingAck = false` so a follow-up forced
  post isn't swallowed. Plain paused-idle posts nothing.
- **Behavior-preserving:** the renderer always shows the latest snapshot, so
  dropped intermediate frames are automatically replaced by current state at the
  next post. `startLoop()` resets `awaitingAck = false` so a fresh run starts
  unblocked; the terminal branch posts unconditionally before `stopLoop()`.
- **Over-acking is harmless:** if the main thread renders a stale snapshot twice
  (e.g. 60 Hz main / 30 Hz effective worker) it acks twice; the worker may post
  one redundant snapshot. No semantic change.

**Multiple consumers (future).** The gate assumes a *single* acking consumer:
the next post is released by the one `snapshotAck` the main thread sends. If a
second consumer (e.g. a replay recorder, a second view, or a debug inspector)
reads the stream, the single-ack model is insufficient — a slow or absent second
consumer would stall the stream for the primary renderer. Supporting multiple
consumers will require either (a) a per-consumer ack with the worker releasing a
post only when *all* registered consumers have acked, or (b) monotonic snapshot
sequence ids so each consumer acks independently and the worker posts when the
*latest* snapshot has been consumed by the slowest consumer. A safety
max-latency fallback (post anyway if `awaitingAck` has been true beyond N ms)
 should also be reconsidered then so a stalled consumer cannot starve the others.
This is the main open design point before introducing additional stream readers.

### Second Renderer (Text Minimap)

The **Minimap** is a fun second renderer that consumes the same `SimulationSnapshot`
data the SVG renderer drains, but draws the map as a monospaced text grid (3×3
characters per tile) with a thin dot/line canvas overlay for projectiles and
minimized effects. It is the first concrete test of the "multiple consumers"
open design point above.

**It is a passive second consumer of the snapshot, not a second acking reader.**
The simulation's snapshot stream is single-ack gated (§"Snapshot Backpressure"),
and `SvgGameRoot.vue` is the *sole* acker. To avoid that gate entirely, the Minimap
reads the snapshot via the existing module-level `getLatestSnapshot()` exported
from `src/sim/SnapshotStore.ts` (the same seam `StatsPanel` uses). `TextGameRoot.vue`
runs its own `requestAnimationFrame` loop, clears + redraws its `<canvas>` overlay
each frame from `getLatestSnapshot()`, and **never posts `snapshotAck`** (and never
touches the worker). This makes it a true "second view" of the already-drained
snapshot — behavior-preserving, no worker/ack changes. No `gameStore` snapshot field
is introduced; the panel resets on a new run automatically because
`uiStore.initForRun` resets `showMinimap` to its default (`false`).

**Layering.** A single `<pre>` cannot be per-cell colored, so rendering splits:
- the `<pre>` base layer is the static, dim monochrome grid (`TextGridBuilder`),
  built once on mount — terrain `·`, path spaces, base `#`, spawn `S`;
- the `<canvas>` overlay draws all dynamic content each frame: tower glyphs
  (theme `icon`/`color`) at tile centers, enemy glyphs (theme `shape` →
  `getEnemyGlyph` → glyph, in theme `color`) at the enemy's scaled continuous
  `enemy.x/enemy.y`, plus projectile dots, HP bars, lightning lines, and stun marks
  (`TextTowerManager` / `TextEnemyManager` / `TextOverlayRenderer`).

**Coordinate mapping.** Because monospace glyphs are taller than wide, the overlay
uses *separate* x/y scales so glyphs sit exactly in their `<pre>` cells:
`cellWidthPx` (char advance) and `cellHeightPx` (line box) are measured on mount
(with a non-zero `fontSize`-derived fallback when `measureText` returns 0, e.g.
jsdom). Canvas size = `grid.width*3*cellWidthPx` × `grid.height*3*cellHeightPx`;
`scaleX = (3*cellWidthPx)/36`, `scaleY = (3*cellHeightPx)/36`. The `<pre>` and the
`<canvas>` share one computed font/line-height so they align. The canvas managers
take the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` as a constructor-free `render(ctx, …)` parameter
(rather than calling `canvas.getContext` internally) so they are testable with the
global `mockCtx` from `tests/setup.ts`.

### LLM Enemy Commander

A pluggable AI layer that issues `llm:*` commands to influence enemy behavior
(hold positions, route to waypoints, set targeting). Two built-in "brains" ship as
stubs for future LLM integration.

**Architecture.** Three pieces:

- **Relay** (`src/commanders/relay.ts`): Main-thread, passive `SnapshotStore` reader
  at ~4 Hz. Builds a `CommanderSnapshotSlice` (throttled, not full snapshot), posts
  to the commander worker, and forwards returned `Command[]` via
  `commandBus.dispatchCommand`. Owns a `gridLayout` cache keyed to `runId` so the
  one-shot feed-off toggle stays valid across worker restarts within a run. Does
  **not** post `snapshotAck` — the single-ack backpressure gate (§"Snapshot
  Backpressure") is untouched. A run restart (engine reloads a map → `runId` bumps)
  drops the stale `gridLayout` cache so the previous map is never forwarded to the
  worker for the new run.
- **CommanderWorker** (`src/commanders/CommanderWorker.ts`): Dedicated worker running
  the brain. Receives `start`/`stop`/`observation` messages. On each observation,
  builds a `CommanderObservation` from the slice, calls `brain.decide(observation,
  memory)`, and posts the returned `Command[]` back. Resets memory on `runId` change.
- **Brains** (`src/commanders/brain.ts`, `src/commanders/stubby/brain.ts`,
  `src/commanders/stubbs/brain.ts`): Pure functions of `CommanderObservation` +
  `CommanderMemory` → `Command[]`. `CommanderMemory` is worker-owned scratch (phase,
  seen-by-wave, last-rush-wave, tower signature, cached grid layout).

**Observation** (`src/commanders/observation.ts`): Pure projection — enemy world x/y
→ tile via `meta.tileSize`, tower `health/maxHealth` → `hp/maxHp`, pending spawn
count summed across `spawnStates`. Field names are intentionally stable for a future
LLM commander (§ArchitecturePlan §4.3).

**Protocol** (`src/commanders/protocol.ts`): `CommanderSnapshotSlice` is the
intentional input contract — a throttled, abstracted slice of the full
`SimulationSnapshot` (enemies, towers, spawnStates, meta) plus a `gridLayout`
cache supplied by the relay, not the whole thing.

**Two built-in brains:**

- **Sergeant Stubby** (`src/commanders/stubby/brain.ts`): Hold-then-rush. While a
  wave is still emerging (`remainingScheduledSpawns > 0` or `pendingEnemyCount > 0`),
  holds each newly-seen enemy at its current tile via `llm:holdFormation`. Once the
  wave finishes emerging, releases all held enemies of that wave in one
  `llm:routeGroup(enemyIds, [])` rush to the base. State keyed by wave number so
  spillover never dilutes a prior wave's rush.
- **Commander Stubbs** (`src/commanders/stubbs/brain.ts`): Aggressive, never holds.
  Computes BFS distances from every base tile over path/spawn/base tiles. For each
  newly-seen enemy, picks the highest-HP live tower that is *ahead* (closer to base)
  of the group's representative tile, snaps to the nearest path tile, and issues
  `llm:routeGroup` with that waypoint. Re-routes whenever the tower set signature
  changes.

**Lifecycle** (`src/commanders/index.ts`): `setEnemyCommander(kind)` starts the relay
(which spawns the worker and sends `start`); `"none"` stops it.
`stopEnemyCommander()` dispatches `llm:routeGroup(enemyIds, [])` for every live enemy
(reverts held enemies to default path) before stopping the relay.

### Router Navigation Guards

`router.beforeEach` disposes the game engine and saves progress when leaving `/game`. Auto-redirects to `/game-over` or `/victory` when the game state transitions.

### Camera

Camera state (`x`, `y`, `zoom`) lives on `gameStore.camera` and is shared between the Vue UI and SVG rendering. Vue-side reactive transforms/conversions are provided by `src/composables/cameraUtils.ts` (`useCameraCTM`), while pixel-space helpers (`fitToGrid`, `screenToWorld`) live in `src/render/svg/cameraUtils.ts`. There is no longer a separate `services/` directory.

## Map Theme System

A theme swaps the visual identity of towers, enemies, and map tiles on `/game`, while leaving all gameplay stats, effects, overlays, and non-`/game`/`/map-select` screens untouched. The current polygon-based art is the default theme (`id: "default"`).

### How It Works

1. **Theme registry** (`src/render/themes/index.ts`): `MAP_THEME_MANIFEST` lists available themes with `{id, label}`. Lazy loaders resolve theme JSON files on demand.
2. **Theme store** (`src/stores/mapTheme.ts`): `useMapThemeStore` holds `defaultTheme` (preloaded at app init for synchronous access by non-game screens) and `activeTheme` (resolved for the current run).
3. **Theme JSON** (`src/render/themes/data/`): `default-map-theme.json` (default polygon art) and `the-aftermath.json` (alternate theme). Each contains tower frames (SVG `<svg>` strings), enemy walking/hit-reaction frames, per-region tile images (path + 4 terrain heights), and base 3×3 SVG art.
4. **Symbol ID contract**: IDs stay `tower-${type}-f${i}`, `enemy-${type}-f${i}`, `enemy-${type}-hit-f${i}`. Themes swap only the *content* inside `<symbol>`s and the color/name/icon metadata. Render managers need zero changes.
5. **Stats vs visuals split**: `TOWER_BASE`, `TOWER_VARIANTS`, `ENEMY_TYPES` numeric fields, `MAP_LEVELS`, gem multipliers — all stay in constants files. Only visual/displayed fields (name, color, icon, shape, animation frames, tile images) live in the theme JSON.

### Scope

- **In scope** (`/game` only): Tower SVG sprites + color/icon/name, enemy SVG sprites + color/shape/name, per-region tile images + base art + display names.
- **Out of scope**: All gameplay data, all effects/overlays (particles, lightning, HP bars, range circles, etc.), non-`/game`/`/map-select` screens (Skill Tree uses default theme), in-game theme switching, audio.

### UI Integration

- **MapSelect**: Theme drop-down selects active theme; grid uses responsive `auto-fill` layout; `startMap` awaits theme resolution before navigating to `/game`.
- **GameShop / TowerPanel / StatsPanel / GameHud**: Read themed name/color/icon from `mapThemeStore.activeTheme` on `/game`.
- **SkillTree / HistoryScreen / EndScreen**: Read from `mapThemeStore.defaultTheme` (not active theme).
- **SvgGameRoot**: Passes `activeTheme` to `GameEngine` constructor and `useSvgStaticContent` composable.
- **Router guard**: `/game` requires `mapThemeStore.activeTheme` to be non-null.

## Persistence

Game progress (gems, unlocks, difficulty, map progress) is saved to `localStorage` under the key `lol_ya_tdg_save_1` (legacy `gempath_save_v1` data is auto-migrated on load). The `persistStore.load()` call in `main.ts` restores saved state on app startup. The `mapThemeStore.preloadDefault()` call in `main.ts` preloads the default theme synchronously before `app.mount()`. Profile reset is available from the main menu.

## Game Routes

| Route | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `MainMenu.vue` | Main menu with difficulty slider and navigation |
| `/map-select` | `MapSelect.vue` | Map selection grid with theme drop-down, responsive layout, awaits theme resolution before navigation |
| `/skill-tree` | `SkillTree.vue` | Gem-based upgrade tree |
| `/game` | `GameScreen.vue` | Active gameplay with single SVG root + UI overlays |
| `/game-over` | `EndScreen.vue` | Game over screen (`won: false`) |
| `/victory` | `EndScreen.vue` | Victory screen (`won: true`) |
| `/history` | `HistoryScreen.vue` | Run history with gem breakdown |

## CSS Theming

CSS custom properties are defined in `App.vue` for consistent theming:

```css
--color-bg, --color-panel, --color-border, --color-accent,
--color-gold, --color-gem, --color-danger, --color-success,
--color-text, --color-text-dim, --font-main
```

All component styles use `<style scoped>` to prevent leakage.
